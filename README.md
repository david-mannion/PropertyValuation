# PropertyValuation
Pricing properties using xgboost regression

The 'Feature_Importance.pdf' file contains a plot of the importance of each feature for the model. 
The 'HousingPriceIndex.csv' file contains data from data.cso.ie which I used in my analysis.
The 'output.csv' file contains the predictions of my model for each house id
Running this will generate the model predictions and print the MdPE, MdAPE, PPE10 and PPE20 results
